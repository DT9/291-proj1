/*Prescription

This application program is used by a doctor to prescribe a medical test to a patient. The program shall allow a user to enter the detailed information about the prescription, including the employee_no or name of the doctor who prescribes the test, the test name, and the name and/or the health_care_no of the patient. As expected, all the prescriptions conflict to the not_allowed constraints must be rejected.

Your program shall automatically generate a suitable test_id for the test_record, and use the NULL value properly for the task.

One needs not to specify when and where the test shall be conducted.
